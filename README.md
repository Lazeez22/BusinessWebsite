Description: 

 For our project, we created a PC components shop website using HTML and CSS.
         
         
My main contribution:
        
   I created the home page, contributed minimal changes on the header navigation of the website.
   

What I Learned:

   Minimal design is best in this case because it greatly attracts attention given that customer's attention is a must in this business.
   Also, I learned animation effects in texts and hover in which our professor didn't include in our lecture session.
         
               
Note:

   Our school did not sponsor GitHub nor recommended to us. I just suggested this to our group since it can enhance our productivity.
   Also, I have no idea how to deploy this. But I can be viewed via https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (Just paste the html link of home.html).

    <h1>Our Pee See Story</h1>

    <p>Where We Started</p>

    <p>
      Pee see is a computer retail business founded on the values of
      convenience, accessibility, and excellent customer service. Believe it or
      not, this leader in local technology retail had pretty humble beginnings-
      when six students who were passionate about tech hunted down secondhand
      PCs in the Tipic PC online group to resell at decent rates. <br />Pee see
      officially got its name when we worked on our first website for a school
      activity. Its name was a key step in buildung a brand that promises
      reliable services and quality products. Eventually, we shifted to selling
      brand new products at accessible prices.

        <p>Where We Started</p>
       
        <p>Pee see is a computer retail business founded on the values of convenience, accessibility, and excellent customer service. Believe it or not, this leader in local technology retail had pretty humble beginnings- when six students who were passionate about tech hunted down secondhand PCs in the Tipic PC online group to resell at decent rates.
            <br>Pee see officially got its name when we worked on our first website for a school activity. Its name was a key step in buildung a brand that promises reliable services and quality products. Eventually, we shifted to selling brand new products at accessible prices.
